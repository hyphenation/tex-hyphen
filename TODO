This is a list of things that needs to be done to propagate the changes properly.
Write DONE to each issue once resolved.

TeX Distributions:
- [DONE] propagate changes into TeX Live
- [DONE] coordinate with Christian Schenk <cs at miktex.org> for changes in MikTeX
- [DONE] coordinate with Akira Kakuto <kakuto at fsci.fuk.kindai.ac.jp> for changes in W32TeX

Pattern creators:
- make a list of pattern authors, notify them about changes,
  explain them that they need to modify UTF-8 file/submit file it as UTF-8 in future
- write DONE for each language once you receive the answer from the author

Languages:
- complete languages.html
- unification of Mongolian
  - encoding
  - pattern versions
    - [DONE] a list of differences received from Dorjgotov Batmunkh <bataak at gmail.com>
    - add that list to repository
    - waiting for answer from Oliver Corff <corff at zedat.fu-berlin.de>
- unification of Spanish (some new version of patterns submitted)
- join Serbian patterns & describe differences between sh-cyrl and sr-cyrl
- [DONE] do something with EO: I did the conversion for "plain" patterns, but left the original version intact
  we could leave a separate version in "source" and use the "plain version" in pattern repository
- Russian etc. that are still outsourcing
  - solve encoding mess
- versioning: German etc.
- Norwegian
- Add Indic scripts & auto-updater

CTAN:
- move old patterns to obsolete
- [DONE] upload new patterns
- make an easy-to-browse structure
- ask CTAN people to be careful if someone uploads new patterns
- write auto-notificator for changes in CTAN

OpenOffice:
- write auto-notificator for changes in OOo (more important)
- contact the authors & join the efforts
- import indic scripts

Impromevents:
- prepare a better version of notes
- auto-conversion into four different files:
  - licence
  - list of used letters for each language (lowercase and uppercase equivalent); difference between letters & others
  - [DONE] list of patterns
  - [DONE] list of exceptions
- that list should be auto-generated from TeX sources and used for [complete a list]:
  - hyphenator
  - ...
- LuaTeX patterns

Documentation:
- authors, history, changes
- how to use patterns in plain TeX
- how to use patterns in LaTeX with polyglossia (or babel?)
- how to use patterns in ConTeXt
- how to add a new language (once we quit the project)

Testing:
- collect lists of words for the languages where that is possible (no copyright problems)
- write a luatex tester for a collection of words for each language

Licences:
- ... complete the list with tasks that need to be done
- we want two licences: one for content and one for packaging
- write a simple licence for packaging:
  - we don't care what others (outside of TeX world) do; just mention the credit to hyph-utf8
    and complete credit to pattern authors
  - respect the licence of pattern authors
  - within TeX world:
    - keep the functionality; implementation may change, but not the end result (unless improved)
    - contact the list first when changes are needed
    - if team disappears, one should be free to continue the work (mention how that should be done)
    - some general guidelines:
      - no TeX commands (apart from \hyphenation and \patterns)
      - everything in Unicode
      - hyph-xx.tex will keep containing the patterns
      - loadhyph-xx.tex will keep loading the patterns, but may change considerably (ugly tricks should go there)
      - ... (complete the list)
    - language-specific:
      - author of existing patterns has full right to submit changes
      - when a new author comes and the old one doesn't respond ... what to do?
      - when two version of patterns appear, try to convince the authors to combine the patterns
        ... write some general guidelines
- collect a few ideas for valid licences (maybe a different licence f)
- write the authors if they agree with that licence (give them a few options to choose from)
- write some really nice, easily parsable form and apply to all the patterns
- modify generating scripts for:
  - German
  - gl
  - eu, tk, tr

Example of a licence:

This work consists of two parts:
a) patterns for different languages
b) support files (tex files, generating scripts, documentation, ...)
with two different licences for each:
1) for within the TeX world
2) and outside the TeX world

A short version of licence:
b2) We don't care what you do, though it would be nice of you to mention the source of patterns (hyph-utf8 residing at http://tug.org/tex-hyphen) at some visible place.
b1)

a1)

Collaboration:
- make a list of people that we would want to collaborate with
- some notification system for those using our patterns as source for whenever something in repository changes
- write done for everyone we have collaborated with

TeX users:
- [on the way] write DOC about pattern conversion
- [DONE] write an article for TUG boat and/or other TeX magazines
- [DONE] maybe present the main idea at some TUG conference
- notify mailing lists
- CTAN people should take care for new patterns to be submitted in the proper form

Web page:
- split the page into several subpages:
  - short intro & news
  - languages - list all available language and add proper links
  - collaboration and links
  - description of algorithm (with Mathias' slides)
- nicer design
- apply Mathias' Hyphenator.js
- add a test page to do hyphenation on-the-fly using Mathias' code
  and creating some really nice output
  - a dropdown box chooses the language
  - text input field
  - button for submission (maybe we don't even need that)
  - sample output

Software:
- possibly rewrite patgen to handle UTF-8
  - [DONE] try to convince Mathias Nater to do that; Deadline: BachoTeX 2011 :)

Some other changes:
- [half done by Norbert] unify pattern loading with both plain TeX/LaTeX
- there is now language.dat + xxhyph.tex - one will be redundant
  (get rid of it once all the patterns are converted)

OpenOffice:
- http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/en/project/RomanianDictionaryPackCedillaVersion
- (kurdish) http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/en/project/kitandin

Hello Mojca,

Hello François,

Not so long ago the author of  Mongolian patterns has asked us for
"help about how to use his patterns in TeX Live 2008/09". (They are
called "mongolian2a" in language.dat since there are two version of
Mongolian patterns in TeX Live - both different patterns and different
encoding. I'm not sure that I know how to enable those patterns in
LaTeX in some nice way.)

First question: does polyglossia work ok with 8-bit engines (pdftex)
as a replacement for babel?
  

No. It assumes Unicode encoding and is currently for XeLaTeX only.
Together with Elie Roux I plan to add support for LuaLaTeX in a later version (not very soon however).

Second question: would you be willing to write a short introduction
(in tex or maybe even better in html forhttp://tug.org/tex-hyphen/)

about how to use some particular patterns in polyglossia (maybe we
should start promoting polyglossia via our webpage, in particual if
the answer to my first question was positive).
  

Sure.

The short answer is:

Since Babel's hyphen.cfg is built in the xelatex format, hyphenation patterns can be used without even loading polyglossia (or Babel for that matter). At the low-level this simply corresponds to defining
   \language=\l@<langname>
(where langname is the string identifying a particular hyphenation file in language.dat). The user command for this is
   \hyphenrules{langname}
or
   \begin{hyphenrules}{langname} ... \end{hyphenrules}.

The above works with any flavour of LaTeX, and I think it is also available in Plain TeX with
   \hyphenrules{langname}
   ...
   \endhyphenrules



In particular, we need to provide examples of usage in {plain TeX,
LaTeX, XeTeX, XeLaTeX, ConTeXt, Lua(La)TeX} for different encodings. I
can write something about ConTeXt, but I need help for different
flavours of LaTeX.
  

Under "plain" pdftex, xetex, and luatex, one can use the macro \uselanguage{langname} for any language mentioned in language.def. It's that simple!

Under polyglossia this is all done automatically, as in Babel, within the individual language definition files, depending of the options associated with each language. Example:

\usepackage{polyglossia}
\setmainlanguage{asturian}
\setotherlanguage[variant=usmax]{english}% American English with extended hyphenation patterns
\setotherlanguage[spelling=new,latesthyphen=true]{german}% German with experimental patterns "ngerman-x-latest"
\setotherlanguages{spanish,catalan,french}
\begin{document}
Long Asturian text ... (Hyphenation for Asturian is not available, but polyglossia automatically falls back on Catalan for now, which seems to be a reasonable choice.)

\begin{german}
Deutscher Text ... (with the hyphenation patterns selected above: "ngerman-x-latest")
\end{german}

\begin[script=fraktur,spelling=old]{german}
Deutſcher Text ... (set in Fraktur, with traditional hyphenation).
\end{german}

etc.

Feel free to adapt and use the above to your liking!

Regards,
François
