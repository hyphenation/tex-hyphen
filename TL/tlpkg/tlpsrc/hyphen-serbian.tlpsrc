shortdesc Serbian Hyphenation Patterns
longdesc Hyphenation patterns for Serbian language in UTF-8 and 8-bit variant.
longdesc For 8-bit TeX the patterns are available separately as 'serbian' in
longdesc T1/EC encoding for Latin script and 'serbianc' in T2A encoding for
longdesc Cyrillic script. UTF-8 engines should only use 'serbian'
longdesc which has patterns in both scripts combined.
