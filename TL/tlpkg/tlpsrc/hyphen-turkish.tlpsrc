shortdesc Turkish hyphenation patterns.
longdesc Hyphenation patterns for Turkish in T1/EC and UTF-8 encodings.
 longdesc The patterns for Turkish were first produced for the Ottoman Texts
 longdesc Project in 1987 and were suitable for both Modern Turkish and Ottoman
 longdesc Turkish in Latin script, however the required character set didn't fit
 longdesc into EC encoding, so support for Ottoman Turkish had to be dropped to
 longdesc keep compatibility with 8-bit engines.
