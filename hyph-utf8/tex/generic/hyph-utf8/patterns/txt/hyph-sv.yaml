changes:
    - 1991-01-08: First version available for anonymous FTP.
    - 1991-08-08: Changed \aa to \aa0 at end of line, to stop TeX from
          concatenating the patterns.
    - 1991-09-03: Cleaned up lots of inconsistencies in the dictionary.
          As a consequence, the patterns shrunk a lot.  Also added some 4000
          one-syllable words, some of which were hyphenated by the old
          patterns, and some 1500 compound words, about half of which were
          incorrectly hyphenated by the old patterns.
    - 1991-11-01: Added another some 6200 compound words, all of which were
          incorrectly hyphenated by the old patterns.
    - 1991-11-13: Added another some 6500 compound words, all of which were
          incorrectly hyphenated by the old patterns.
    - 1992-01-30: Changed macros to ^^, for use with LaTeX and dc fonts.
    - 1994-03-03: The hyphenated dictionary now contains about 118,000 words.
          The hyphenation now works much better for compound words.
          Patgen parameters 1 2 20, 2 1 8, 1 4 7, 3 2 1, 1 10000 4.

==========================================
These hyphenation patterns work quite well for simple words, but not
quite as well for compound words.  I'm working on improving the quality,
by adding more words.  If you know any Swedish words which are not
correctly hypheneted using these patterns, or if you have questions or
comments, please contact me:\n
