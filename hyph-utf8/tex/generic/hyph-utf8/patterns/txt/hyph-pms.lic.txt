% ==========================================
% These hyphenation patterns for the Piedmontese language are supposed to comply
% with the common spelling of the Piedmontese language as fixed by the
% "Gramatica dla lengua piemonteisa" by Camillo Brero.
% They were initially obtained by merging the consonant endings to the Italian
% patterns and adding the necessary patterns for the special Piedmontese digraphs
% used in this language. The common Latin roots of both languages helped a lot
% in this adaptation.
% Digraphs: cc, ch, gi, gh, gn, ss.
