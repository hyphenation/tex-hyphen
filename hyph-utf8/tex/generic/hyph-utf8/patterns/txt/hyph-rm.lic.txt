% ==========================================
% These hyphenation patterns for the Romansh language are supposed to comply
% with the rules indicated by the Lia Rumantscha (Romansh language society).
% They were initially obtained by merging the consonantic endings to the Italian
% patterns and adding the necessary patterns for the special Romansch di-, try- and
% tetra-graphs used in this language. The common Latin roots of both languages helped
% a lot in this adaptation.
% Digraphs: ch, gh, gl, gn, tg
% Trigraphs: sch
% Tetragraphs: tsch

% First part is identical to what is contained in hyph-quote-rm.tex
% It must be repeated because that file is read only when creating format files
