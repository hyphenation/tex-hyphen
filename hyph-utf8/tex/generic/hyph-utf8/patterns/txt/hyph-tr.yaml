        Hyphenation patterns for Turkish in T1/EC and UTF-8 encodings.
        Auto-generated from a script included in the distribution.
        The patterns for Turkish were first produced for the Ottoman Texts
        Project in 1987 and were suitable for both Modern Turkish and Ottoman
        Turkish in Latin script, however the required character set didn't fit
        into EC encoding, so support for Ottoman Turkish had to be dropped to
        keep compatibility with 8-bit engines.

Differences with Ottoman patterns:
- adapted for the use on modern TeX engines, using UTF-8 charactes
- only letters for Modern Turkish + âîû (the first one often needed, the other two don't hurt)
- (if needed, support for Ottoman Turkish might be provided separately under language code 'ota')\n
