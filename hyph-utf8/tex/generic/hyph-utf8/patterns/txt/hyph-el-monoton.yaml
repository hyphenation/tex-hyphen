    package: greek
==========================================
This file was first created by mechanical translation from
GRMhyph5.tex via "elhyph-utf8 -m -c" (version 0.1 by Peter
Heslin -- p.j.heslin at durham dot ac dot uk). Some additions
were also made by hand.\n
Created by Dimitrios Filippou with some ideas borrowed from
Yannis Haralambous, Kostis Dryllerakis and Claudio Beccari.
Mojca Miklavec adapted it for the "hyph-utf8" package.\n
These hyphenation patterns are explained in "modern.pdf", which
can be found in the "elhyphen" or "hyphenation-greek" package.\n
Documentation in English can be found in: D. Filippou,
"Hyphenation patterns for Ancient and Modern Greek," in
"TeX, XML, and Digital Typography" (A. Syropoulos et al.,
eds.), Lecture Notes in Computer Science 3130, Springer-Verlag
Berlin-Heidelberg, 2004. ISBN 3-540-22801-2.\n
