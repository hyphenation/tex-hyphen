Principles of the Bulgarian hyphenation
=======================================\n
One specificity of the Bulgarian language is that the average length
of the words is greater than in English.  When typesetting a Bulgarian
text, hyphenation is more important than when typesetting an English
text.  Knuth's algorithm for line-breaking is such that in most
English paragraphs no hyphenation will be used.  With a Bulgarian
text, however, even the Knuth's algorithm will use hyphenation in most
paragraphs.  Hyphenation becomes an absolute necessity if we want to
obtain nice, justified paragraphs when using a software with dumb
line-breaking algorithm, such as LibreOffice.\n
According to Decree 936 of the Council of Ministers promulgated on 27
November 1950, the Institute for Bulgarian Language at the Bulgarian
Academy of Sciences is authorised to publish the rules of the
orthography of the Bulgarian language (within certain limits).\n
Hyphenation rules between 1945 and 1983
---------------------------------------\n
Between 1945 and 1983 Bulgarian used syllable hyphenation with two
morphological exceptions: hyphenation is preferred between a prefix
and a stem and at the boundary of compound words.  The following were
the rules governing the hyphenation:\n
1. One letter does not stay alone.  Words of one syllable can not be
   hyphenated.
2. No hyphenation before or after ь.
3. In a sequence of vowels at least one vowel stays before the
   hyphen.
4. A single consonant between two vowels links with the second vowel.
   For example по-ле /po-le/, ра-бо-та /ra-bo-ta/.
5. In a sequence of consonants between two vowels, at least one
   consonant stays with the second vowel.  For example те-сто /te-sto/
   or тес-то /tes-to/.[^b]
6. In a sequence of consonants between two vowels, if the first
   consonant is sonorant (й /y/, л /l/, м /m/, н /n/, р /r/), then it
   stays with the first vowel.  For example гер-дан /ger-dan/, сен-ки
   /sen-ki/.
7. The hyphenation separates two successive equal consonants. For
   example времен-но /vremen-no/, пролет-та /prolet-ta/.
8. When the letters дж /dzh/ and дз /dz/ denote a single consonant,
   then they are not separated.  For example боя-джия /boya-dzhiya/
   but not бояд-жия /boyad-zhiya/.  When these letters denote two
   consonants, then the normal rules apply: над-живявам
   /nad-zhivyavam/.
9. Word prefixes may not be broken.  Compound words are hyphenated
   either at the boundary of the components or the hyphenation rules
   are applied to each of the components separately.  For example:
   пред-упреждавам /pred-uprezhdavam/ (not пре-дупреждавам
   /pre-duprezhdavam/), пред-известие /pred-izvestie/ (not
   пре-дизвестие /pre-dizvestie/), за-движвам /za-dvizhvam/ (not
   зад-вижвам /zad-vizhvam/), авто-клуб /avto-klub/ (not авток-луб
   /avtok-lub/), вакуум-апарат /vakuum-aparat/ (not вакуу-мапарат
   /vakuu-maparat/).\n
In some rare cases the proper application of rule 9 depends on the
semantics of the word.  For example пре-дреша /pre-dresha/ 'change
clothes' but пред-реша /pred-resha/ 'predetermine' or прес-пите
/pres-pite/ 'the snow-drifts' but пре-спите /pre-spite/ 'sleep for a
while/overnight'.\n
[^b]: In several publications this rule is formulated with the
    additional restriction that the sequence of consonants begins with
    an obstruent.  I believe this restriction is unintentional.  It
    makes no sense to forbid a hyphenation of the form AB-A but to
    permit ABB-A (A denotes a vowel and B – a consonant).\n
Hyphenation rules between 1983 and 2012
---------------------------------------\n
The Orthographic dictionary published by the Institute for Bulgarian
language in 1983 introduced new hyphenation rules.  The complexity of
the previous rules was the main reason for the change.  The new rules
aimed at two objectives: simplicity and unambiguity.\n
The new rules are:\n
1. A consonant between two vowels links with the second vowel.  For
   example ви-со-чи-на /vi-so-chi-na/.
2. In a sequence of two or more consonants between two vowels, at
   least one consonant stays with first vowel and at least one with
   the second vowel.  For example сес-тра /ses-tra/ and сест-ра
   /sest-ra/.
3. Two equal consonants are separated.  For example плен-ник
   /plen-nik/.
4. In a sequence of two or more vowels, the first vowel stays before
   the hyphen.  For example пре-одолея /pre-odoleya/ and прео-долея
   /preo-doleya/.
5. In a sequence of three or more vowels, the last vowel stays after
   the hyphen.  For example мао-изъм /mao-izam/ but not маои-зъм
   /maoi-zam/.
6. The letter й /y/ between a vowel and a consonant stays with the
   vowel.  For example май-ка /may-ka/.
7. When a sequence of two or more consonants follows й /y/ then at
   least one consonant links with й /y/.  For example айс-берг
   /ays-berg/ (not ай-сберг /ay-sberg/).
8. The letter й /y/ between two vowels links with the second vowel.
   For example ма-йор /ma-yor/.
9. No hyphenation before or after ь.
10. When the letters дж /dzh/ denote a single consonant, then they are
    not separated.  For example су-джук /su-dzhuk/ (not суд-жук
    /sud-zhuk/) but над-живея /nad-zhiveya/.
11. There must be at least one vowel before and after the hyphen.
12. One letter does not stay alone.\n
The total disregard of the morphology by these rules leads to some
strange results.  For example пре-дизвестие /pre-dizvestie/ is
permitted and пред-известие /pred-izvestie/ is forbidden, зад-вижвам
/zad-vizhvam/ is permitted and за-движвам /za-dvizhvam/ is forbidden,
авток-луб /avtok-lub/ is permitted and авто-клуб /avto-klub/ is
forbidden, вакуу-мапарат /vakuu-maparat/ is permitted and
вакуум-апарат /vakuum-aparat/ is forbidden.  Because of this, the new
rules were not universally accepted.  The old rules are still
mentioned in various places in Internet, they are included even in
some grammar books published by the publishing houses of the Ministry
of Education and of Sofia University.  The software developers,
however, soon came into love with the new hyphenation rules.\n
Hyphenation rules after 2012
----------------------------\n
In 2012 new rules came into force.  There are two differences with
respect to the previous rules:\n
1. Rule 5 of the previous rules is revoked.  For example маои-зъм
   /maoi-zam/ becomes a valid hyphenation.
2. The new rules permit morphologically based hyphenation (however it
   is not obligatory).  For example пред-известие /pred-izvestie/,
   за-движвам /za-dvizhvam/, авто-клуб /avto-klub/, вакуум-апарат
   /vakuum-aparat/ are valid hyphenations.\n
Good hyphenation is a complex matter and it seems the linguists at the
Institute for Bulgarian Language have recognised this.  They no longer
attempt to provide universal rules about everything.  Instead, they
provide some very permissible rules while the good application of
these rules is leaved to the discretion and the experience of the
printers and the developers of hyphenation software.\n
It makes sense to use at least two different sets of hyphenation rules
for Bulgarian.  In most cases a more restrictive version should be
used, one which attempts to eliminate the controversial cases of
hyphenation.  When typesetting a Bulgarian text in a narrow newspaper
column, however, it will be appropriate to use more liberal
hyphenation rules.  It should be noted that one of the reasons for the
hyphenation reform in 1983 was the desire to fix the chaotic
hyphenation in the Bulgarian newspapers at that time.\n
Computer implementations
========================\n
Mathematical analysis of the Bulgarian hyphenation
--------------------------------------------------\n
The earliest mathematical analysis of the Bulgarian hyphenation rules
belongs to Veska Noncheva.[^1] In 1988 she proposed a mathematical
formalisation of the hyphenation rules in a table with 22 rows.[^2]\n
[^1]: <http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Veska_Noncheva>\n
[^2]: Нончева В. Алгоритъм за автоматично пренасяне на думи в
    българския език. Математика и математическо
    образование. Сб. доклади на 17. ПК на СМБ. С., БАН, 1988, 479-482.\n
In the same year Eugene Belogay[^3] proposed an alternative
formalisation with only 9 rules.[^4] Belogay proved that his rules are
consistent and that they form a minimal set.  The rules of Belogay
have negative character – every hyphenation which is not forbidden by
a rule is possible hyphenation.\n
[^3]: <http://www.linkedin.com/in/belogay>\n
[^4]: Белогай Е. Алгоритъм за автоматично пренасяне на думи. Компютър
    за вас (1988) 3, 12-14.\n
The following are the first 7 rules, as formulated by Belogay:\n
1. Б-А
2. А-ББ
3. Б-ТТ, ТТ-Б
4. ААА-Б
5. й-ББ
6. Б-ь
7. д-ж\n
Here А denotes an arbitrary vowel letter, Б denotes an arbitrary
consonant letter (including ь and й), ТТ denotes a sequence of two
equal consonant letters and the letters й, ь, д and ж denote
themselves.  For example the rule "Б-А" says that we are not permitted
to separate a consonant letter from immediately following vowel
letter.\n
The eighth rule of Belogay says that hyphenation is forbidden before
the first and after the last vowel letter.  The ninth rule of Belogay
says that hyphenation is forbidden immediately after the first or
immediately before the last letter of the word.\n
Notice that is is very easy to translate the rules of Belogay in the
form, required for the hyphenation algorithm of Knuth and Liang used
in TeX.[^a] Let us remind that this algorithm matches the word with a
set of string patterns in which the odd numbers say hyphenation is
permitted in this position and even numbers say the hyphenation is
forbidden.  When two patterns give conflicting numbers for the same
position, then the greater number wins.\n
First, since the rules of Belogay are negative (they say where
hyphenation is forbidden, not where it is permitted), we have to
permit the hyphenation everywhere:\n
1. А1
2. Б1\n
Then, the first seven rules of Belogay obtain the form:\n
1. Б2А
2. А2ББ
3. Б2ТТ ТТ2Б
4. ААА2Б
5. й2ББ
6. Б2ь
7. д2ж\n
Since no Bulgarian word starts with more that four consonants and no
Bulgarian word ends with more than three consonants, the eighth rule
of Belogay can be translated in the following way:\n
1. .Б2
2. .ББ2
3. .БББ2
4. 2Б.
5. 2ББ.\n
The ninth rule of Belogay means that left and right hyphen mins should
be set to 2.\n
The work of Eugene Belogay was not limited to merely a mathematical
analysis of the Bulgarian hyphenation rules.  In his paper he
published a short algorithm in Pascal which implements these rules.
It didn't take long for this algorithm to be used in various text
processing software.  The algorithm of Belogay was famous for many
years.  Even as late as 1997 in one book about TeX, the author didn't
care to give any explanations but simply wrote about "the algorithm of
Belogay" as something well known to the reader.[^5]\n

Bulgarian hyphenation in TeX
----------------------------\n
One unfortunate design decision of Knuth was that the hyphenation
algorithm of TeX applied the hyphenation patterns not to the input
character codes but to the internal codes of the glyphs in the font.
This created a problem for the Cyrillic languages because in TeX the
Cyrillic fonts did not have standardised encoding.  Perhaps this is
one of the reasons why the earliest implementations of the Bulgarian
hyphenation in TeX did not rely on the internal hyphenation algorithm
of TeX.  Instead, external tools were used to insert soft hyphens in
all Bulgarian words.  For example such a tool would replace the word
сричкопренасяне /srichkoprenasyane/ with
срич\\-коп\\-ре\\-на\\-ся\\-не /srich\\-kop\\-re\\-na\\-sya\\-ne/.
The saying "To every disadvantage there is a corresponding advantage"
is true – since Cyrillic and Latin letters use different character
codes, an external tool could easily insert soft hyphens in all
Bulgarian words while leaving the TeX commands intact.\n
The earliest known attempt to use the hyphenation algorithm of TeX for
Bulgarian was made by Ognyan Tonev in 1990.[^6] He described his work
as "a not very good translation of the rules.  I work in this
direction.  But I don't have a 100% working complect of patterns.  So,
the copy I send to you[^7] is only a beta-version."  The hyphenation
patterns of Tonev don't work correctly and it seems he never completed
his work.\n
[^6]: The author of this text was unable to find current information
    about Ognyan Tonev in Internet.  Apparently in 1990 he worked in
    the Center of Informatics and Computer Technology of the Bulgarian
    Academy of Sciences.\n
[^7]: To Yannis Haralambous,
    <http://perso.telecom-bretagne.eu/yannisharalambous>\n
The first usable Bulgarian hyphenation patterns for TeX were developed
by Georgi Boshnakov[^8] in 1994.  In order to solve the encoding
problem, Boshnakov had developed TeX fonts supporting the MIK encoding
(the prevalent encoding at that time in Bulgaria).  This allowed him
to introduce a fully working implementation only a few months after
LaTeX2e became the official LaTeX version.  Later Boshnakov modified
his work with the Babel system.  The hyphenation patterns of Boshnakov
did their job well enough, so that for almost quarter a century after
their initial creation, they remained the only Bulgarian hyphenation
patterns in the standard distributions of TeX and CTAN.\n
[^8]: <http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~gb/>\n
There are some similarities between the patterns of Boshnakov and the
patterns of Belogay.  The following are the main differences.\n
First, Boshnakov used an ingenious and more compact implementation of
the second and the third rule.  Instead of {А2ББ, Б2ТТ, ТТ2Б}, or
8×22×22+22×22+22×22=4840 patterns in total, Boshnakov has patterns of
the form 2Б3Б2 and 4Т3Т4, or only 22×22=484 in total, with the same
effect.\n
The second main difference between the patterns of Boshnakov and the
patterns of Belogay concerns the letter combination дж /dzh/.  In
Bulgarian this letter combination can denote either a single
consonant, or a sequence of two consonants and the hyphenation rules
change respectively.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to know the
meaning of дж /dzh/ without a vocabulary.  The solution of Belogay was
a cautious one – his rules do the hyphenation in a way which will be
correct regardless of whether дж /dzh/ is a single consonant or a
sequence of two consonant.  On the other hand, the approach of
Boshnakov is a bold one – since дж /dzh/ is more often a single
consonant, his rules assume that it is always a single consonant.  The
number of the cases when this decision leads to bad hyphenations is
insignificant in comparison with the cases in which we obtain improved
hyphenation.\n
The third main difference between the patterns of Boshnakov and the
patterns of Belogay concerns the eighth rule – its implementation in
the rules of Boshnakov is rather limited which leads to wrong
hyphenations like бри-дж /bri-dzh/.  A full implementation of this
rule would require 11660 patterns in total and this would be too much
for the computers in 1994.\n
Later developments
------------------\n
In 1995 Atanas Topalov defended a Masters thesis in the Faculty of
Mathematics and Informatics at Sofia University titled "Algorithms and
software about text processing".[^9] One of the main topics in his
thesis was the Bulgarian hyphenation.  Topalov criticised vehemently
the official hyphenation rules and their total disregard of the
morphology.  He wrote:\n
> If we look at the history of the problems of the hyphenation, we
> will discover something very strange.  Instead of the expected
> involvement with the depths and aspiration for more admissible and
> satisfactory style, we can find a growing tendency for
> simplification.  One unpleasant discovery is that the development of
> the hyphenation software stays firmly on the principle "let us do
> the easiest thing".  The earliest works which have been studied are
> from 1978.  It turned out that they present the best approach
> concerning the automated hyphenation.  The authors have chosen the
> most difficult but the most correct (from literary point of view)
> method for hyphenation, namely the morphological approach.\n
Topalov proposed his own hyphenation algorithm.  The hyphenation it
generated was smooth and easy to read.  One obvious defect of the
algorithm of Topalov was that it contradicted the official hyphenation
rules at that time.  One can argue, however, that his algorithm is
compatible with the current hyphenation rules.\n
[^9]: The thesis of Atanas Topalov can be accessed at the author's
    website <http://www.mind-print.com>\n
In 1999 Svetla Koeva[^10] wrote a paper about the automated Bulgarian
hyphenation.[^11] At that time she was a junior member of the
Department of Computational Linguistics at the Institute for Bulgarian
Language but now she is a director of the whole institute.  The paper
of Koeva contains a list of hyphenation patterns which can be used as
a basis of automated hyphenation.  In 2004 with the help of Stoyan
Mihov[^12] the rules of Koeva were formalised with regular relations
and rewriting rules.  They were implemented in a software product
named ItaEst which provided Bulgarian hyphenation and grammar checking
for various software products of Microsoft and Apple.\n
[^10]: <http://dcl.bas.bg/svetla_koeva/>\n
[^11]: Коева, Светла. Правила за пренасяне на части от думите на нов
    ред. Български език. 1999/2000, 1, 84-86\n
[^12]: <http://lml.bas.bg/~stoyan/>\n
The main differences between the hyphenation of Koeva and the official
hyphenation rules effective after 2012 is that the separation of a
long sequence of consonants between two vowels is done according to
the rules valid before 1983.  For example се-стра /se-stra/ and
ай-сберг /ay-sberg/ are permitted.  The main difference between the
hyphenation of Koeva and the official hyphenation rules effective
before 1983 is that the rules of Koeva disregard the morphology of the
words.  The following rule of Koeva is specific: in a sequence of two
sonorant consonants between two vowels, we are permitted to separate
the first vowel from the first consonant, for example материа-лна
/materia-lna/.\n
In 2000 Anton Zinoviev[^13] created new hyphenation patterns for TeX.
He didn't know about the previous work of Boshnakov and he didn't
bother to make his work available in the various TeX distributions and
CTAN.  His work was used mostly by the local Linux enthusiasts and the
colleagues of Zinoviev.  In 2001 Radostin Radnev[^14] created a free
grammar dictionary of Bulgarian[^15] where he used the hyphenation
patterns of Zinoviev.  From there the work of Zinoviev propagated to
OpenOffice, LibreOffice and various online dictionaries, including
<http://bg.wiktionary.org> and <http://rechnik.chitanka.info>.\n
[^13]: The author of this text.\n
[^14]: <http://bg.linkedin.com/in/radostinradnev>\n
[^15]: <http://bgoffice.sourceforge.net/>\n
The following are the main differences between the hyphenation of
Zinoviev and the hyphenation of Boshnakov.\n
First, the eighth rule of Belogay is fully implemented.\n
Second, the rules of Zinoviev try to detect when the letters дж /dzh/
(and дз /dz/) denote a single consonant and when they denote a
sequence of two consonants.  By default, however, Zinoviev (like
Boshnakov) assumes that дж /dzh/ is a single consonant and hyphenates
accordingly.\n
Third, the rules of Zinoviev disable some cases of unpleasant
hyphenations:\n
1. In a consonant sequence like тст /tst/, the two equal consonants т
   /t/ are separated.  For example братст-во /bratst-vo/ is forbidden
   while братс-тво /brats-tvo/ and брат-ство /brat-stvo/ are
   permitted.
2. The hyphenation is forbidden after a sonorant consonant following
   an obstruent consonant.  For example отм-ра /otm-ra/ is forbidden
   and от-мра /ot-mra/ is permitted.
3. The hyphenation separates two consecutive kindred voiced/voiceless
   consonants.  For example субп-родукт /subp-roduct/ is forbidden and
   суб-продукт /sub-product/ is permitted.\n
At the start of his work on the Bulgarian hyphenation, Zinoviev had
the opportunity to discuss the hyphenation with Svetla Koeva.  He
remembers that some cases of unpleasant hyphenation were suggested to
him by Koeva.  Unfortunately, he hasn't taken notes so now he doesn't
know which cases of unpleasant hyphenation have been suggested to him
by Koeva and which are his own findings.\n
The present work
================\n
Motivation
----------\n
The present work was carried out on the initiative of the leader of
the Bulgarian localisation team of Mozilla, who contacted Zinoviev,
Boshnakov and the maintainers of the TeX hyphenation patterns.[^17]
This work pursues the following main objectives:\n
1. to update the hyphenation patterns in accordance with the current
   hyphenation rules;
2. to generate the hyphenation patterns by a publicly available
   script;
3. to make the hyphenation patterns customisable;
4. to provide documentation for the future developers.\n

[^17]: <http://hyphenation.org>\n
The current official hyphenating rules for Bulgarian are rather
liberal.  Very often, in a long sequence of consonants we are
permitted to split the word at any position, for example аген-т-с-т-во
/agen-t-s-t-vo/.  This is prone to many unusual and unexpected results
that interrupt the attention of the reader or deceive his expectations
during the movement of his eyes to the next line.  On the other hand,
in order to produce nice justified paragraphs there is no need for so
many hyphenation possibilities.  It would be sufficient even if only
one possible separation between any two syllables was permitted.\n
Therefore, it makes sense to use a more restrictive version of the
Bulgarian hyphenation, one which eliminates the controversial cases of
hyphenation.  Only when typesetting a Bulgarian text in a very narrow
newspaper column it will be appropriate to use a more liberal version.
It should be noted that some specialised English dictionaries also
separate the word-division positions into two categories – preferred
positions and less recommended positions.\n
There are two methods to determine the optimal division within a
sequence of consonants between two vowels:\n
* we can hyphenate according to the syllables in the word or
* we can hyphenate morphologically.\n
Hyphenation according to the syllables in the word
--------------------------------------------------\n
Let us look at the properties of the Bulgarian syllables.  All
syllables have the following structure:\n
> onset - nucleus - code\n
The nucleus in Bulgarian is always a vowel.  Both the onset and the
code are (possibly empty) sequences of consonants.\n
The Bulgarian syllables adhere to the Sonority Sequencing Principle.
According to this principle, the consonants within the onset have
raising sonority and the consonants within the code have decreasing
sonority.\n
Several grammar books agree that the following sonority scale is valid
for Bulgarian:\n
> voiceless obtrusive < voiced obtrusive < sonorant consonant < vowel\n
According to the investigations of the author, the only exception to
this law is due to the letter в /v/ which is a voiced obtrusive but it
can be used also as a voiceless obtrusive.  This exception is due to a
spelling particularity of the Bulgarian language.  Whenever the letter
в /v/ seemingly violates the Sonority Sequencing Principle, in the
spoken language this letter is read as ф /f/, that is as a voiceless
obtrusive (for example the word отвсякъде /otvsyakade/ is read as
отфсякъде /otfsyakade/).[^18]\n
[^18]: No Primitive Slavonic word contains the phoneme ф /f/.
Therefore, we can safely assume that in the Primitive Slavonic
language the consonant ф /f/ was a positional variant of the consonant
в /v/.\n
The author has found that the sonorant consonants in Bulgarian have
their own sonority scale:\n
> м /m/ < н /n/ < л /l/ < р /r/ < й /y/\n
Only a few words such as жанр /zhanr/ and химн /himn/ violate this
scale.  Such words are always loan-words and their pronunciation is
somewhat problematic for the native Bulgarian speakers.\n
In addition to the Sonority Sequencing Principle, the consonant
clusters within the Bulgarian syllable adhere to the following
additional principles:\n
1. Both in the onset and in the code, the labial and dorsal plosives
   precede the coronal plosives and affricates.
2. If the onset or the code contains two plosives or affricates, then
   there are no fricatives between them.  Few words with the Latin
   root 'text' are exceptions: контекст /kontekst/.
3. If the onset or the code contains two fricatives other than в /v/,
   then there are no plosives or affricates between them.
4. If the onset or the code contains two plosives or affricates, then
   they both have equal sonority (both are voiced, or both are
   voiceless).
5. If the onset or the code contains two fricatives other than в /v/,
   then they both have equal sonority (both are voiced, or both are
   voiceless).
6. Neither the onset, nor the code may contain two labial plosives, or
   two coronal plosives or affricates or two dorsal plosives.
7. Neither the onset, nor the code may contain two equal consonants
   with the exception of в /v/ (for example втвърди /vtvardi/).[^19]\n
[^19]: Actually, the letter в /v/ is not a real exception because in
all such cases this letter denotes two different consonants – в /v/
and ф /f/.  Only in the Russian loan-word взвод /vzvod/ the two
letters в /v/ denote a repeating consonant в /v/.\n
From all these properties of the Bulgarian syllable we can deduce the
following hyphenation rules:\n
1. In a sequence МК where М is a consonant with higher sonority than
   K, we are not permitted to hyphenate before М.  Exception: when М
   is в /v/ and К is a voiceless consonant.
2. In a sequence КМ where М is a consonant with higher sonority than
   K, we are not permitted to hyphenate after М.
3. In a sequence KBT where K and T are plosives or affricates and B is
   fricative, we separate K from T.
4. In a sequence CKB where K is a plosive or affricate and C and B are
   fricatives other than в /v/, we separate C from B.
5. If in a consonant sequence a coronal plosive or affricate Т is
   followed by a labial or dorsal plosive К, then we separate Т from К.
6. If a consonant sequence contains two plosives or affricates, one
   voiced and one voiceless, then we separate them.
7. If a consonant sequence contains two fricatives other than в /v/,
   one voiced and one voiceless, then we separate them.
8. If a consonant sequence contains two labial plosives or two coronal
   plosives or affricates or two dorsal plosives then they are
   separated.
9. If a consonant sequence contains two equal consonants (not
   necessarily consecutive), then they are separated.\n
With so many prohibitive rules, a question arises: if we apply all
these rules, aren't we going to eliminate too many hyphenation
possibilities?  The answer is no.  It can be demonstrated that between
any two consecutive syllables at least one separation point will be
permitted.\n
Hyphenation according to the morphology
---------------------------------------\n
Between 1983 and 2012 the official orthographic rules of the
Bulgarian language forbade morphologically based hyphenation.  After
2012 such hyphenation is permitted (but not obligatory).\n
The most important case when it is very desirable to use
morphologically based hyphenation is the case of the compound words.
Divisions such as авток-луб /avtok-lub/ and вакуу-мапарат
/vakuu-maparat/ are extremely irritating even if they are formally
correct.  Unfortunately, we do not have a vocabulary of the compound
Bulgarian words that would permit us to produce rules for automated
hyphenation.  Therefore, the current Bulgarian hyphenation patterns do
not attempt to apply morphological hyphenation to such words.\n
Second in importance (but far more significant in terms of numbers) is
the case with the word prefixes.  While the eyes of the reader still
look at the start of the word, the word is still unknown to him.  At
this point, it is very important not to deceive his expectations.  For
example, when the reader sees над- /nad-/ at the end of the line, he
will expect that this is the prefix над- /nad-/ with semantics 'attain
more than'.  This expectation will be fooled if this wasn't really a
prefix, but a deceiving (while formally correct) hyphenation of the
word надремя /nadremya/ 'have dozed enough' where the real prefix is
not над- /nad-/ but на- /na-/ with semantics 'achieve a state after
accumulation'.  Such hyphenation distracts the reader and makes the
reading more difficult.\n
Third in importance is the case with the word suffixes.  With respect
to the hyphenation rules we can divide the suffixes into three
categories:\n
1. Suffixes starting with a vowel, for example -ар /-ar/.  It is not
   appropriate to follow the morphology with such suffixes because
   this will contradict the whole hyphenation tradition of the
   Bulgarian language.  For example крав-ар /krav-ar/ is unwarranted.
2. Suffixes starting with one consonant, for example -ка /-ka/.
   Usually with such suffixes the syllable boundary in the word
   coincides with morpheme boundary so no specific cares are
   necessary, for example кравар-ка /kravar-ka/.  The exceptions are
   rare, for example: обек-тната /obek-tnata/ instead of обект-ната
   /obekt-nata/.
3. Suffixes starting with more than one consonant (-ски /-ski/, -ство
   /-stvo/).  It is possible to use morphological hyphenation rules
   with such suffixes.\n
Even if it is possible to use morphological hyphenation with the
suffixes of the third category, it turns out, this is not as useful as
it is with the case of the prefixes.  When the eyes of the reader have
reached this part of the word, the word is already more or less known
to the reader.  Therefore, at this point the morphological hyphenation
does not provide any significant advantages in comparison to the
simpler hyphenation based only on the syllables in the word.  Consider
for example the word геройс-тво /geroys-tvo/ with suffix -ство
/-stvo/.  When the reader sees геройс- /geroys-/ at the end of the
line this will give him an early clue that the suffix of the word is
-ство /-stvo/.  Such non-morphological hyphenation does not deceive
the expectations of the reader.  On the contrary, it makes the reading
easier because it gives clues to the reader about what follows on the
next line.\n
Because of these considerations, the current Bulgarian hyphenation
patterns do not attempt to use morphological hyphenation with respect
to the suffixes of the words.  Though it would be useful to implement
rules about the suffixes of the second cateogory.  Hopefully, some
future version will have such rules.\n
Occasionally,[^20] a fourth morphological requirement is stated: that
hyphenation should conform with the boundary between the word and the
definitive articles -та /-ta/ and -те /-te/ (postfixed in Bulgarian).
There is no need to pay attention to this rule because it seems to be
satisfied by its own nature.  The author has searched in a dictionary
with over 860000 Bulgarian words for cases when the hyphenation rules
would hyphenate badly with respect to the definitive article.  He was
unable to find even one such case with the hyphenation rules valid
after 1983 and only about 10 cases with the rules valid before 1983
(one of them is живопи-ста /zhivopi-sta/ instead of живопис-та
/zhivopis-ta/).\n
One unavoidable characteristic of any morphologically based automated
hyphenation is that it can create wrong hyphenations.  Because of
this, one useful option is to use the morphology in a safe way – to
use it in order to forbid bad hyphenations but to create no new
hyphenation possibilities solely on the basis of the morphology.\n
Take for example the word дозрея /dozreya/ 'ripen fully'.  According
to the phonological rules, we should hyphenate it as доз-рея
/doz-reya/.  According to the morphology, however, we should hyphenate
as до-зрея /do-zreyq/ because this word is formed with the prefix до-
/do-/ with semantics 'complete or supplement' and this semantics would
be lost if the reader sees доз- /doz-/ at the end of the line.
Therefore, there are three methods to hyphenate this word:\n
1. доз-рея /doz-reya/ when morphology is not used;
2. до-зрея /do-zreya/ when morphology is fully used;
3. дозрея /dozreya/ (no hyphenation) when morphology is used in a safe
   way.\n
The option to use the morphology in a safe way is very attractive when
the software uses a smart line-breaking algorithm which can produce
good results even with less hyphenation possibilities.  TeX is one
such software.  It should be noted that this option does not eliminate
too many hyphenation possibilities because the morpheme boundaries
most of the time are also syllable boundaries.\n

The following are results of a statistics about the quality of the
morphological rules (the number after the sign ± is the expected
standard deviation of our estimations):\n
With the option `--morphology`:\n
* in 0.1% ±0.3% of the dictionary words the morphological patterns
  create very wrong hyphenation;
* in 89.8% ±0.1% of the dictionary words the morphological patterns
  hyphenate identically with the case when no morphology patterns are
  used;
* in 0.3% ±0.2% of the dictionary words the morphological patterns
  hyphenate differently in comparison to the case when no morphology
  patterns are used and the word is hyphenated in a way which
  contradicts the morphology;
* in 0.6% ±0.1% of the dictionary words the morphological patterns
  hyphenate differently in comparison to the case when no morphology
  patterns are used and there is a possible hyphenation which is
  compatible with the word morphology but which is nevertheless
  forbidden by the morphology patterns.
  
With the option `--safe-morphology`:\n
* in 0% of the dictionary words the morphological patterns create very
  wrong hyphenation;
* in 90.0% ±0.1% of the dictionary words the morphological patterns
  hyphenate identically with the case when no morphology patterns are
  used;
* in 0.3% ±0.2% of the dictionary words the morphological patterns
  hyphenate differently in comparison to the case when no morphology
  patterns are used and the word is hyphenated in a way which
  contradicts the morphology;
* in 0.6% ±0.1% of the dictionary words the morphological patterns
  hyphenate differently in comparison to the case when no morphology
  patterns are used and there is a possible hyphenation which is
  compatible both with the word morphology and with the syllable
  boundaries but which is nevertheless forbidden by the morphology
  patterns.
  
Notice that the morphological patterns create a different hyphenation
only in about 10% of the words.  The following explanation can be
given for this surprising fact.  First, the natural evolution of the
human languages tends to simplify the complex sequences of consonants.
Therefore, no morpheme contains a complex sequence of consonants.  And
second, the Bulgarian orthography is morphological.  This means that
the morphemes are written according to their actual pronunciation,
however the simplifications in the spoken languages which take place
at the morpheme boundaries are not taken into account in the
orthography.  The independent operation of these two factors leads to
the result that most of the time the morpheme boundaries coincide with
the conventional syllable boundaries.  The main exception to this is
when a morpheme starts with a vowel, in this case its syllable will
include one or more consonants of the preceeding morpheme.  The second
exception is when a morpheme ends with a vowel and the next morpheme
starts with a sequence of two or more consonants.\n
