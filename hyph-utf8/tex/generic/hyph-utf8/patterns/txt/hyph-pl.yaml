changes:
    - The first version of the patterns was developed
          by Hanna Kołodziejska (1987).
    - The adaptation to the LeX format (see below) and extensive modification
          were done by Bogusław Jackowski & Marek Ryćko (1987--1989).
    - The hyphenation rules were further improved and adapted to the
          TeX 3.x requirements by Hanna Kołodziejska (1991).
    - Lone-standing version (3.0a) of patterns was prepared (under pressure
          from LaTeX users) by Bogusław Jackowski and Marek Ryćko, following
          Mariusz Olko's suggestions, 1995.
    - The LeX format mentioned above was the first version of the adaptation
          of TeX to the Polish language. The next version is called MeX.
