==========================================
Special thanks to: Jim Hefferon and Robin Fairbairns\n
There are few basic rules in mongolian\n
1. If there is a consonant then it can use hyphen before it.
   And if there're two consonants then it can use hyphen before second consonant.
   Are there three consonants then it can put hyphen before third consonant,
   also are there four consonants then it can use hyphen before fourth consonant.
2. In the case of hardsign or softsign, it's possible to hyphen after these signs.
   For instance, байгуулъ-я, үзүүль-е
3. However one vowel can be belong to a syllable, it's not possible to use hyphen.\n
