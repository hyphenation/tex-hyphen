==========================================
Aknowledgements: This file has been substantially upgraded with
the contributions of Francisco Gracia. \n
Patterns for the classical Latin language; classical spelling
with the (uncial) lowercase ‘v’ written as a ‘u’ is supported.
Classical Latin hyphenation patterns are different from those of
“plain” Latin, the latter being more adapted to modern Latin.\n
