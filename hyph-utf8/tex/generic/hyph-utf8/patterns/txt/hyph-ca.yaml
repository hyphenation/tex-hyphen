==========================================\n
This patterns have been created using standard, conservative
hyphenation rules for catalan. The results have refined running them
through patgen. In that way, the number of hits has been increased.\n
These rules produce no wrong patterns (Results checked against the
“Diccionari Ortogràfic i de Pronúncia”, Enciclopèdia
Catalana. The percentage of valid hyphen misses is lower than 1%\n
Some of the patterns below represent combinations that never
happen in Catalan. We have tried to keep them to a minimum.\n
Please report any problem you might have to the authors!!!\n
