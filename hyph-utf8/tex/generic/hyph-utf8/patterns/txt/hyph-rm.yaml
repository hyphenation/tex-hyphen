        Hyphenation patterns for Romansh in ASCII encoding.
        They are supposed to comply with the rules indicated by the Lia
        Rumantscha (Romansh language society).
==========================================
These hyphenation patterns for the Romansh language are supposed to comply
with the rules indicated by the Lia Rumantscha (Romansh language society).
They were initially obtained by merging the consonantic endings to the Italian
patterns and adding the necessary patterns for the special Romansch di-, try- and
tetra-graphs used in this language. The common Latin roots of both languages helped
a lot in this adaptation.
Digraphs: ch, gh, gl, gn, tg
Trigraphs: sch
Tetragraphs: tsch\n
