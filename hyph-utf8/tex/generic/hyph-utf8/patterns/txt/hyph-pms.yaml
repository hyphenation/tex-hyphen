        Hyphenation patterns for Piedmontese in ASCII encoding.
        Compliant with 'Gramatica dla lengua piemonteisa' by Camillo Brero.
==========================================
These hyphenation patterns for the Piedmontese language are supposed to comply
with the common spelling of the Piedmontese language as fixed by the
"Gramatica dla lengua piemonteisa" by Camillo Brero.
They were initially obtained by merging the consonant endings to the Italian
patterns and adding the necessary patterns for the special Piedmontese digraphs
used in this language. The common Latin roots of both languages helped a lot
in this adaptation.
Digraphs: cc, ch, gi, gh, gn, ss.\n
