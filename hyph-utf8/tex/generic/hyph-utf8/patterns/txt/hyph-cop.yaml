        Hyphenation patterns for Coptic in UTF-8 encoding
        as well as in ASCII-based encoding for 8-bit engines.
        The latter can only be used with special Coptic fonts (like CBcoptic).
        The patterns are considered experimental.
==========================================\n
Unicode (UTF-8) patterns generated by copthyph-utf8 script\n
These patterns for use with XeTeX should be considered experimental
and are provided with no warranty or support!\n
Changes made to the original (non-Unicode) patterns
* catcode and lccode settings disabled
* Letters within the patterns mapped to Unicode as follows:
  #  =>  ⲯ
  )  =>  ⲝ
  +  =>  ⲫ
  .  =>  .
  /  =>  ϩ
  1  =>  OMIT
  2  =>  ⳉ
  3  =>  ϯ
  8  =>  ⲑ

Hyphenation patterns for Coptic valid for the "copto" font which
does not comply with any official encoding scheme (does really exist
out here an official TeX compliant font encoding for coptic fonts?)
**********************************************
VVVVERY EXPERIMENTAL !!!!!!!!!!!!\n
This pattern set allows hyphenation just before or between consonants
No attempt is made to distinguish diphthongs and/or hyathi.\n
Rules 1. a consonant followed by a vowel belong to the same syllable
      2. a group of consonants is divided in such a way that the right
         syllable consonants may appear also at the beginning
         of a Coptic word\n
Compound words are divided without any attention to component words;
manual intervention is required in case of bad divisions.\n
The decimal TeX charcodes, the Coptic glyphs and the corresponding ASCII
signs (if any) are in the following table.
