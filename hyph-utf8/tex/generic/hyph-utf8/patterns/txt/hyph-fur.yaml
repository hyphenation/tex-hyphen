==========================================
These hyphenation patterns for the Friulan language are supposed to comply
with the common spelling of the Friulan (Furlan) language as fixed by the
Regional Law N.15/96 dated November 6, 1996 and its following amendments.
They were initially obtained by merging the consonantic endings to the Italian
patterns and adding the necessary patterns for the special Friulan digraphs
used in this language and for the \c{c} consonant. The common Latin roots
of both languages helped a lot in this adaptation.
Digraphs: cj, gj, gl, gn, sj, ss.\n
