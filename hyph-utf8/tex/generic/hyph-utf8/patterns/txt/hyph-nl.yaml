        Hyphenation patterns for Dutch in T1/EC and UTF-8 encodings.
        These patterns don't handle cases like 'menuutje' > 'menu-tje',
        and don't hyphenate words that have different hyphenations according
        to their meaning.

==========================================
PURPOSE: 8-bit hyphenation patterns for TeX based upon the new Dutch
         spelling, officially since 1 August 1996. These patterns follow
         the new hyphenation rules in the ‘Woordenlijst Nederlandse
         Taal, SDU Uitgevers, Den Haag 1995’ (the so called ‘Groene
         Boekje’) described in section 5.2 (Het afbreekteken).\n
         The main differences with our earlier patterns based upon the
         CELEX dictionary are:
          (1) provide 8-bit patterns based upon the T1 character encoding
              (the encoding for DC/EC compatible TeX fonts)
          (2) don’t hyphenate if this results in a syllable of one letter
              before or after the hyphen (hence hyphens in a-drenaline,
              studi-o, mensa-pen and vide-oachtig are invalid)
          (3) handle words derived from other languages (‘bastaard
              woorden’) according to the new rules\n
         Like the CELEX patterns these patterns don’t hyphenate:
          (4) in a changing syllable (menuutje can not be hyphenated as
              menu-tje)
          (5) in words that have different hyphenations according to
              there meaning (buur-tje/buurt-je)\n
