==========================================
This file has been renamed from ukhyphen.tex to hyph-en-gb.tex in June 2008
for consistency with other files with hyphenation patterns in hyph-utf8 package.
No other changes made. See http://www.hyphenation.org/tex for more details.\n
Created by Dominik Wujastyk and Graham Toal using Frank Liang's PATGEN 1.0.
Like the US patterns, these UK patterns correctly hyphenate about 90% of
the words in the input list, and produce no hyphens not in the list
(see TeXbook pp. 451--2).\n
These patterns are based on a file of 114925 British-hyphenated words
generously made available to Dominik Wujastyk by Oxford University Press.
This list of words is copyright to the OUP and may not be redistributed.
The hyphenation break points in the words in the abovementioned file is
also copyright to the OUP.\n
We are very grateful to Oxford University Press for allowing us to use
their list of hyphenated words to produce the following TeX hyphenation
patterns.  This file of hyphenation patterns may be freely distributed.\n
These patterns require a value of about 14000 for TeX's pattern memory size.\n
