        February 1997 Patterns created by Juan M. Aguirregabiria, based on the
        shyphen.sh script for Spanish by Julio Sanchez, September 1991.

        26 June 2008 Generating script rewritten in Ruby and adapted for native
        UTF-8 TeX engines, patterns renamed from bahyph.tex to
        hyph-eu.tex and added to the hyph-utf8 package.  Functionality should
        not change apart from adding ñ by default.
